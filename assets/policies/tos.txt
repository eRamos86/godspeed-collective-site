Terms of Service

Effective Date: [Insert Date]

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of this website and any photography, videography, or related creative services provided by Godspeed Collective LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing this website, booking services, or making a payment, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use this website or our services.

1. Services

We provide photography, videography, editing, and related creative services, including but not limited to portraits, automotive photography, events, weddings, commercial shoots, and digital media delivery.

Specific details (scope, date, location, deliverables, pricing) will be agreed upon in writing (email, invoice, or contract). These Terms apply in addition to any project-specific agreement.

2. Booking & Payments

A non-refundable retainer may be required to secure a booking.

Full payment is due by the date specified on the invoice or agreement.

We reserve the right to cancel or withhold services for non-payment.

All prices are listed in USD unless stated otherwise.

Payments are processed through third-party providers (e.g., Stripe). We do not store your payment information.

3. Cancellations & Rescheduling

Client cancellations forfeit the retainer.

Rescheduling requests must be made at least 48 hours in advance and are subject to availability.

We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule due to illness, equipment failure, unsafe conditions, weather, or events beyond our control. If we cancel, payments made (excluding completed work) will be refunded or credited.

4. Creative Discretion

You acknowledge that photography and videography are subjective. We retain creative discretion over style, composition, editing, and final output.

Requests for specific edits must be made within 7 days of delivery. Excessive revisions may incur additional fees.

5. Delivery of Files

Delivery timelines are estimates and not guaranteed unless stated in writing.

Final files are delivered digitally unless otherwise agreed.

We are not responsible for loss of files after 30 days from delivery. Clients are responsible for backing up their files.

6. Copyright & Usage Rights

We retain full copyright to all images and media unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Clients are granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use delivered media for personal or commercial use as specified in the agreement.

Clients may not sell, sublicense, or alter the media for resale without written permission.

We reserve the right to use images for portfolio, website, social media, marketing, and promotional purposes unless the client requests otherwise in writing prior to the shoot.

7. Client Responsibilities

Clients are responsible for securing permissions, permits, and access to locations unless otherwise agreed.

Clients must ensure a safe working environment. We reserve the right to stop work if conditions are unsafe.

Delays caused by the client may reduce coverage time without refund.

8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

We are not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

Our total liability is limited to the amount paid for the services.

We are not responsible for missed shots due to circumstances beyond our control (lighting conditions, weather, subject cooperation, venue restrictions, etc.).
